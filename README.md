# K-Means Clustering for Dataset Visualization

This Python script utilizes the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster a dataset and visualize the results. The dataset is loaded from the `kmeansdata.csv` file, and the features `Distance_Feature` and `Speeding_Feature` are used for clustering. The script plots the original dataset and the clustered data points with different colors.

## Project Structure

1. **`kmeans_clustering.py`:**
   - The main script containing the implementation of K-Means clustering and dataset visualization.

2. **`kmeansdata.csv`:**
   - The dataset file. Replace this file with your own dataset as needed.

3. **`README.md`:**
   - The README file providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the K-Means clustering script.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the K-Means clustering script:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kmeans-clustering.git
   cd kmeans-clustering
   ```

2. Ensure you have a CSV file named `kmeansdata.csv` with the appropriate features.

3. Run the K-Means clustering script:
   ```bash
   python kmeans_clustering.py
   ```

   The script will output two plots - one for the original dataset and one for the clustered data points.

## K-Means Clustering

The script uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to cluster the dataset based on the features `Distance_Feature` and `Speeding_Feature`.

## Dataset Visualization

The script plots the original dataset and the clustered data points with different colors.

## Example Dataset

The sample dataset used for demonstration is loaded from the `kmeansdata.csv` file. Replace this file with your own dataset as needed.
